I reminded myself why I started this journey in the first place. I wan ted to build something for my family and knew I could make it happen if I changed my approach. I accepted that I was in deep trouble because I hadn \u2019t been making the smartest decisions. I was chasing quick wins and not thinking through my actions. I had t o take responsibility and learn from my mistakes. When I opened my mind to a different way, things started to change. Slowly but surely, I improved my product offerings, optimised my website, and built stronger relationships with suppliers. Sales picked up, my confidence grew, and within a few years, I had built a business earning millions of pounds.

I\u2019ve been there. Seeing any kind of negative review feels like a punch in the gut, and your knee -jerk reaction is to take it badly or even ignore it. But o ne day, a bit of a penny dropped for me, and it changed everything: Negative reviews present an opportunity to improve your business and future customer experience. If they \u2019re complaining about a product \u2019s quality, the delivery, or something about your s tore, chances are there \u2019s something you can improve. This will only positively impact your service for future customers. And as for the negative reviewer \u2026 don\u2019t brand them as an awful, horrible person and brush it under the carpet. Chances are, they \u2019re just disappointed or confused, and it \u2019s a bit of a cry for help.

Mistake #1: Picking The Wrong Products You wouldn \u2019t try to sell a surfboard in a desert because you know it\u2019s not the right target market, it \u2019s not solving a problem, and there \u2019s zero demand.

Don \u2019t just pick something that \u2019s trending or that you \u201cTHINK \u201d will sell well. Mistake #2: Relying On Overseas Shipping Because of companies like Amazon, customers have come to expect next -day or very quick delivery. If you rely on overseas shippin g, you \u2019re adding weeks to a delivery timeframe, which increases the chance of unhappy customers and refunds! My biggest tip is to find suppliers in the UK to serve the UK market. Mistake #3: Using Poor Quality Suppliers Always vet your suppliers. If your product doesn \u2019t meet expectations, your brand \u2019s reputation is on the line. You might have a fantastic store and awesome ads, but if your supplier sends out low -quality products, the only thing people will see\u2026 is the negative reviews! Look for high -quality suppliers passionate about their products and willing to work WITH you, not against you.

WHAT you eat is very often more important than HOW MUCH. Remember \u2026 with modern ALPHA \u2026 you\u2019re not here to lose a couple lbs and fall back into your old ways..

Our priority will be getting rid of your actual FAT, not just \u201cWEIGHT LOSS \u201d These are very different things. Weight loss means nothing if it's not mainly fat that you \u2019re losing. Putting yourself into a severe calorie deficit to try and lose weight (as most diets recommend) gets you dropping \u201cweight \u201d not fat \u2026 with the weight loss coming mostly from water, glycogen/muscle depletion.

Slow and steady FAT LOSS while building and retaining lean muscle is key to maintaining a healthy metabolism, because yo u\u2019ll be metabolically flexible! In Modern Alpha, our focus is increasing LEAN muscle WHILE we drop body fat. This is the only way to do things in my opinion. Every pound of lean muscle we add increases how calorie -ef icient your body is, not to mention tha t when we reduce your actual BODY FAT, You have better blood sugar stability which will result in improved insulin sensitivity, meaning you will be able to eat", "increases how calorie -ef icient your body is, not to mention tha t when we reduce your actual BODY FAT, You have better blood sugar stability which will result in improved insulin sensitivity, meaning you will be able to eat the odd cookie or cinnamon bun fearlessly, because your body is a furnace able to use anything f or energy, never wanting to store fat.

Your insulin sensitivity will determine if your body prefers to store FAT, or use it for muscle glycogen and muscle repair. When you improve insulin sensitivity, it will help restore blood sugars to a normal level quickly after eating. (Which is good) The APEX approach for men is to increase lean muscle mass and keep that lean muscle active to stimulate more receptor activity. Here's some tips to help possibly improve insulin sensitivity and stabilize blood sugar levels. 1. 5 -10 minute walks after all meals ( TWICE as effective as the drug metformin for blood sugar control!) 38 2. Increase Collagen/Gelatin Protein - Bone broth is great here. 3. LOSE FA T - Pretty much everyone who loses a lot of body fat, improves blood sugar markers, lowers blood pressure) 4. Reduce carbs to 150G daily. Primarily coming from fruit / potato. 5. AVOID POLYUNSATURATED fats (flax seeds, canola/corn/safflower oils, sunflower seeds, walnuts) 6. INCREASE SATURATED FATS(red meat, grass fed butter, pasture raised eggs, cheese, whole fat yogurt, cottage cheese) UNSATURATED FATS oxidize and create free radicals which trigger stress hormones & inflammation.

Downs ides of keto that don \u2019t void well for my typical client: -Strength & physical performance drop. (shit workouts) -Can have Negative Effect on metabolic health - Prone to muscle loss - Prone to Metabolism decreasing -Worse insulin sensitivity. (also from lean muscle decrease) A big issue with keto is the WEIGHT LOSS VS FAT LOSS discussion. When someone starts a keto diet - They see an immediate drop in weight, this often gets people excited. Understandably. But 90% of this weight loss is from glycogen which wa s being from stored carbohydrates, now depleted In basic terms - you drop a massive amount of water the first 2 weeks because carbs hold water at a 4:1 ratio per gram. This is normal and healthy, it's not bloat. 76 The benefit of keto is keeping insulin lo w, and while you can \u2019t keep insulin elevated and stand a", "weeks because carbs hold water at a 4:1 ratio per gram.

You also can \u2019t recover from workouts OR build muscle if you don \u2019t have any insulin present since Insulin drives muscle growth through its effect on nutrient uptake and protein synthesis.

Without laying SMART goals (most ppl do this wrong) I recommend Setting up to 3 personal goals and up to 3 professional goals MAX. 93 Never setting 20 goals at a time \u2026 you can always add goals as you accomplish these.

YES it can make you fat \u2026 But it 's also the switches that turn on your body \u2019s anabolic process. As the old saying goes, \u201cThe dose makes the poison. \u201d A lot of people think of insulin in a negative way, it gets a wrap for being the \u201cfat storing hormone \u201d and you \u2019ll see a lot of diets and tr ainers simply trying to reduce insulin at all costs. (typically meaning keto style diets which aren \u2019t realistic) What is better is learning how to use insulin to work in your favor, because it's actually a powerful asset to building muscle and key to losin g fat as you age. One key to maximizing fat loss while maintaining muscle is to show your body a higher insulin signal on training days and a null signal during days \u201coff\u201d from weight training.

We might also use \u201cfat fasting \u201d which means you \u2019ll basically only have some healthy fats in your coffee and some almonds, pumpkin seeds or something with high fat and some protein until you break your \u201cfast\u201d Your body type (somatotype) and current body fat will largely determine the amount of carbohydrates I want you consuming at certain times of day. This IS NOT RANDOM. I have a specific fasting window I think will be best for you, which should be easy to manage also. That 1st meal I want you to have after breaking the fast is a lso specific. (don \u2019t binge) This is all determined from what I know about you and your body type, genetics.

We can all improve our insulin sensitivity but different body types are prone to much different levels of insulin sensitivity. It \u2019s not a perfect sc ience so we will be tweaking this as we go along. For example, you could have two athletes. Same exact height and weight. One is an endomorph and the other is an ectomorph body type. 101 They would actually require completely different diets to optimize in sulin and carbohydrates. Even though on paper, they \u2019re the same. A lot of trainers right now with little understanding believe eating less & calories deficits are a weight loss solution because it will reduce circulating levels of insulin. That is a band a id solution with long term downsides. Insulin is the key driver of the anabolic process, allowing us to recover and build new lean muscle from hard workouts.

You can \u2019t keep insulin elevated and lose fat but you also can \u2019t recover from workouts and build muscle if you don \u2019t have any insulin present, since Insulin drives muscle growth through its effect on nutrient uptake and protein synthesis.

Truth #2 No one will ever care \ud83e\udd17 about your business as much as you do. Truth #3 Failure \ud83d\udc4e is part of the daily entrepreneurial experience. Truth #4 How you deal with failure deter mines whether or not you ever get the opportunity to deal with success. Truth #5 You cannot trust your own judgment. Test, test, test \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udd2c. Then test some more.

Today I'm going to share some facts with you --- Business owners care about their income, the entreprene ur cares about their customers Business owners tend to be more focused on day -to-day operations whereas entrepreneurs tend to focus on what will make their money in the long run. Business owners can earn their position by purchasing or inheriting an existi ng company or by starting their own business. Entrepreneurs create their own company from an original idea A business owner typically manages a company that provides products or services that support customers' existing needs.

An entrepreneur establishes t heir company intending to sell a completely original product or service that does not yet exist in the market.

Entrepreneurs only need to work with as many other professionals as they want to.
